## JFROG ARTIFACTORY SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILE
## HOW TO USE: comment-out any field and keep the correct yaml indentation by deleting only the leading '#' character.

configVersion: 1

## NOTE: JFROG_HOME is a place holder for the JFrog root directory containing the deployed product, the home directory for all JFrog products.
## Replace JFROG_HOME with the real path!
## For example, in RPM install, JFROG_HOME=/opt/jfrog

## NOTE: Sensitive information such as passwords and join key are encrypted on first read.
## NOTE: The provided commented key and value is the default.

## SHARED CONFIGURATIONS
## A shared section for keys across all services in this config
shared:
  ## Java 17 distribution to use
  #javaHome: "JFROG_HOME/artifactory/app/third-party/java"

  ## Extra Java options to pass to the JVM. These values add to or override the defaults.
  #extraJavaOpts: "-Xms512m -Xmx2g"

  ## Security Configuration
  security:
    ## Join key value for joining the cluster (takes precedence over 'joinKeyFile')
    #joinKey: "<Your joinKey>"

    ## Join key file location
    #joinKeyFile: "<For example: JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/join.key>"

    ## Master key file location
    ## Generated by the product on first startup if not provided
    #masterKeyFile: "<For example: JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/master.key>"

    ## (Applicable to Artifactory and Xray. Note: not be used when other JFrog services are running).
    ## Enforces external masterkey management. When set to true, the JFrog services expect the masterkey to be provided through an external resource, and will not generate a materkey if one is not provided. Relates to router.masterKeyRemoval parameters.
    #masterKeyExternal: false

    ## Maximum time to wait for key files (master.key and join.key)
    #bootstrapKeysReadTimeoutSecs: 120

    ## Expose application headers (e.g server, node id) for unauthenticated and anonymous calls
    exposeApplicationHeaders: true

  ## Logging Configuration
  logging:
    consoleLog:
      ## If true, all service console logs will be redirected to a common console.log
      #enabled: true
      #format: "jftext"

    ## Log rotation settings
    rotation:
      ## The max file size at which enforce rotation
      #maxSizeMb: 25

      ## The number of backup files to maintain
      #maxFiles: 10

      ## Whether to compress the backup file
      #compress: true
    enableJsonConsoleLogAppenders:
      ## If true, there will be additional logs in JSON format for SaaS

  ## Node Settings
  node:
    ## A unique id to identify this node.
    ## Default auto generated at startup.
    #id: "art1"

    ## When using IPv6 address, be sure to use the IPv6 format, incasing the address with []
    ## Default auto resolved by startup script
    #ip:

    ## Default auto resolved by startup script
    #name: ""

    ## Sets this node as part of HA installation
    #haEnabled: true

    ## One of
    ## 'any' - allow running any kind of background job on this node such as the Artifactory Garbage Collector,
    ## Scheduled Replication, Backup, etc.
    ## 'none' - no background jobs are allowed to run on this node (except for a select group of system jobs)
    ## This attribute and the 'primary' attribute are mutually exclusive. When both are set, only the Primary node can
    ## execute jobs in the cluster.
    ## Default any
    #taskAffinity: any

    ## Deprecated: sets this node as primary in HA installation. This attribute and taskAffinity are mutually exclusive
    #primary: true
